# Archon Brand Guidelines

Parent document: `../../design-system/custodyzero-design-system.docx`
Status: **Placeholder — identity in development**
Version: 0.1 · February 2026

## Brand Character

Archon is the CustodyZero product for agent coordination and control.

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | Agent coordination / enforcement layer |
| Accent color | TBD — electric blue or terminal green (decision pending) |
| Design register | Architectural, system-like, brutalist precision |
| Aesthetic posture | Enforcement as aesthetic. More terminal, less editorial. |
| Audience | Mature Operator — technical precision, proof over promise |

The Archon visual language prioritizes the appearance of a running system over a marketed product. It should feel like infrastructure you configure, not software you adopt.

---

## House Inheritance

Archon inherits from the CustodyZero house foundation:

- **Dark background stack:** `#0A0A0A` → `#111111` → `#1A1A1A`. No exceptions.
- **Typefaces:** Bebas Neue (display), DM Mono (UI / system). Fraunces is a house-level voice font — Archon may substitute a different monospace or technical serif if warranted by product identity.
- **Brand attitudes:** All three CustodyZero brand attitudes apply without modification.
- **Amber (`#D4880A`) is the house accent.** It does not appear as the primary accent in Archon product contexts. Once an Archon accent is confirmed, amber is subordinate.

## Accent Color — Decision Pending

Two candidates are under consideration:

| Option | Rationale | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Electric blue (approx. `#1E90FF` range) | High contrast on near-black, reads as technical/terminal | Over-used in security tooling |
| Terminal green (approx. `#00FF41` range) | Strong terminal association, immediate "system running" signal | Nostalgia risk, high vibrancy may be difficult to control |

Decision will be made during product identity development. Once confirmed, this document will be updated with the exact hex value and token assignment.

## Wordmark Usage

_Stub — to be completed when wordmark is designed._

- Typeface: Bebas Neue
- Color treatment: TBD pending accent color decision
- Background: dark stack only
- Clearspace: TBD
- Minimum size: TBD

---

## Icon Mark Usage

_Stub — to be completed when icon mark is designed._

- Canvas: 64 × 64 px (to match CustodyZero house standard)
- Background: transparent
- Color: TBD accent on transparent
- Design character: architectural, system-like — no surveillance or enforcement metaphors (handcuffs, chains, bars)

---

## Clearspace Rules

_Stub — to be completed when assets are finalized._

Minimum clearspace will follow the house standard: cap height of the wordmark on all four sides.

---

## Minimum Sizes

_Stub — to be completed when assets are finalized._

Minimum size rules will follow the house standard established in the CustodyZero guidelines.

---

## Color on Color Usage

_Stub — to be completed when accent color is confirmed._

Accent color usage will follow the house pattern: accent appears sparingly on interactive elements, dividers, and status indicators. Never decorative.

---

## What Not To Do

_Stub — to be completed when identity is defined._

In addition to all house-level constraints (see CustodyZero GUIDELINES.md):

- Do not use amber as the primary Archon accent in product contexts.
- Do not use illustrative or metaphorical imagery (handcuffs, enforcement badges, surveillance cameras).
- Do not use rounded corners on interactive elements.
- Do not use purple.
