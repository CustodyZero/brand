## Brand Character

Sentinel is the CustodyZero product for home security — local, operator-defined, and private by construction.

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | Home security / local video intelligence |
| Accent color | TBD — to be defined when product identity is built |
| Design register | TBD — inherits CustodyZero house foundation |
| Audience | Dual — see below |

### Dual Audience

Sentinel serves two distinct audiences whose needs must both be served without compromise:

**Self-hosting privacy-conscious consumers**
- They want plain language and clear ownership.
- They are choosing Sentinel specifically because they do not trust cloud-hosted alternatives.
- Brand language: direct, human, translate technical truth into plain promise.

**Regulated enterprise operators** (healthcare, schools, institutions)
- They need compliance-ready infrastructure, documented data residency, and institutional trust signals.
- Brand language: architectural, precise, contractual. Specs and behavior, not feelings.

These audiences share one core requirement: they need to know exactly where their footage is and who can access it. Sentinel's brand must make this concrete, not aspirational.

---

## House Inheritance

Sentinel inherits from the CustodyZero house foundation:

- **Dark background stack:** `#0A0A0A` → `#111111` → `#1A1A1A`. No exceptions.
- **Typefaces:** Bebas Neue (display), DM Mono (UI / system). Voice font TBD.
- **Brand attitudes:** All three CustodyZero brand attitudes apply without modification.
- **Amber (`#D4880A`) is the house accent.** It does not appear as the primary accent in Sentinel product contexts. Once a Sentinel accent is confirmed, amber is subordinate.

---

## Accent Color — Not Yet Defined

Sentinel's accent color has not been defined. It will be determined during product identity development.

Constraints on whatever color is chosen:
- Must not be amber (reserved for house level)
- Must not be purple (forbidden at all levels — see design system)
- Must achieve sufficient contrast against the near-black background stack
- Must be compatible with the Archon accent once that is also confirmed (the two sub-brand accents must not compete or conflict)

---

## Wordmark Usage

_Stub — to be completed when wordmark is designed._

- Typeface: Bebas Neue
- Color treatment: TBD pending accent color decision
- Background: dark stack only
- Clearspace: TBD
- Minimum size: TBD

---

## Icon Mark Usage

_Stub — to be completed when icon mark is designed._

- Canvas: 64 × 64 px (to match CustodyZero house standard)
- Background: transparent
- Color: TBD accent on transparent
- Design character: TBD — must not use surveillance camera, eye, or lens imagery. The mark should imply local custody and defined boundary, not monitoring or observation.

---

## Clearspace Rules

_Stub — to be completed when assets are finalized._

Minimum clearspace will follow the house standard: cap height of the wordmark on all four sides.

---

## Minimum Sizes

_Stub — to be completed when assets are finalized._

Minimum size rules will follow the house standard established in the CustodyZero guidelines.

---

## Color on Color Usage

_Stub — to be completed when accent color is confirmed._

Accent color usage will follow the house pattern: accent appears sparingly on interactive elements, dividers, and status indicators. Never decorative.

---

## What Not To Do

_Stub — to be completed when identity is defined._

In addition to all house-level constraints (see CustodyZero GUIDELINES.md):

- Do not use surveillance camera, eye, or lens imagery.
- Do not use the word "smart" in any product copy.
- Do not imply cloud connectivity as a feature.
- Do not use amber as the primary Sentinel accent in product contexts.
- Do not use purple.
