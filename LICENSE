PERMITTED USES

The following uses are permitted without prior written approval:

  Press and editorial coverage — Journalists and media may use the CustodyZero
  wordmark and product marks in editorial context to accurately identify and
  refer to CustodyZero and its products. Marks may not be altered, combined
  with other marks, or used in a way that implies endorsement.

  Linking and attribution — You may use the wordmark in a standard "built with"
  or "powered by" context when your product or project directly integrates a
  CustodyZero open source project (e.g. Archon). The mark must link to
  custodyzero.com and may not be altered or used at a size that distorts it.

PROHIBITED USES

  - Using CustodyZero marks in your own product name, logo, or branding
  - Modifying, distorting, recoloring, or combining marks with other elements
  - Using marks in a way that implies partnership, endorsement, or affiliation
    that does not exist
  - Using marks on merchandise, physical products, or promotional materials
  - Registering any mark confusingly similar to CustodyZero marks
